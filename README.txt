Hi Team, Welcome to the project we will be working on :)
I would like to demonstrate the structure of the repository



	acuarium|
		|
		|
		---- components // Folder where would be js files which would be supposed to create Components
		|
		|
		---- package.json          //
		---- package.lock.json     // THESE ARE CONFIG FILES
		---- webpack.config.js	   //
		|
		|
		---- src // Here are supposed to be folders for each piece of project
		|
		|
		---- static // here would be constant things(images)
		|
		|	
		---- index.html, app.js  and style.css // these files would represent the whole project
